### Course description

The effective management of research data is a challenge for researchers
in all fields of study. Federal funding agencies require that proposals
contain data management plans and many journals now insist data is
publicly available prior to publication of your research. Therefore we
need to manage our research data effectively throughout our research
projects in order to meet these expectations. Information technology
tools and hardware platforms progressively develop to address data
management needs, but in order to extract the maximum value from our
research then we must manage an ever increasing inventory of data, make
this inventory accessible to the broader research community, and
preserve it for re-use.

This course will provide students with foundations of sound research
data management. Upon completion of the course, students will be aware
of tools and approaches to effectively manage research data from project
inception through publication of both findings and data. Topics include
sound data management principles, version control, database concepts,
metadata generation, data management plans, research collaboration, and
tools for data processing (e.g., spreadsheets, R). This is a hands-on
course in which students will perform exercises with sample data and/or
their own research data. We strongly recommend that students come
prepared with their own laptop computer to maximize the learning
experience.

The extended classroom period is designed to permit some assignments and
practical exercises to be worked on in class with access to instructor
resources.

### Learning objectives

Students completing this course will:

1.  Understand the benefits of a structured approach to managing the
    data produced by research projects and experiments.
2.  Recognize data and metadata quality issues and understand the impact
    on the value of the data.
3.  Be able to organize data and prepare metadata to facilitate
    publication of research data.
4.  Apply data management principles to prepare a Data Management Plan,
    as required by many funding agencies.
5.  Know where to seek new knowledge in this rapidly evolving field -
    unless you are keeping up with it, you are falling behind.

### Course materials

Materials for this class will consist primarily of research articles and
business reports. All documents (or links to the documents) will be made
available through the course GitHub repository prior to the class
period. Instructor presentations will typically be posted to the course
GitHub repository for student review by the weekend following the Friday
class period. Assignments and corresponding grading rubrics are provided
on the course GitHub repository.

**student participation:** Evidence of being prepared for discussion in
class, including but not limited to having completed reading assignments
prior to class, contributing insightful comments, and a commitment to
class activities will demonstrate levels of preparedness and
participation that enable others to learn from and with you.

### Course, Department, and University policies

#### Attendance

  - **General:** Students are expected to be present during all class
    periods. If students anticipate they will need to be absent due to
    illness or other reasons, they need to inform the instructor in
    writing (email is fine) before the class, and propose ways in which
    they will make up missed work if relevant. We expect assignments to
    be turned in at the appropriate time regardless of absence.
  - **Excused absences related to university-sanctioned events and
    activities:** Students who participate in university-sanctioned
    activities that require classes to be missed will be given
    opportunities to make up examinations and other graded in-class
    work. However, absence from class or examinations due to
    university-sanctioned activities does not relieve students from
    responsibility for any part of the course work required during the
    period of the absence. The provost of the university or designee
    shall determine, for the purposes of this policy, whether a
    particular event qualifies as a university-sanctioned activity.
  - **Excused absences related to religious observances/practices:** A
    calendar of religious holidays is posted at
    <https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays>. Students should notify faculty
    at the beginning of the semester about the need to be absent from
    class due to religious observances.

#### Expected Classroom Behavior

Students will not be permitted to interfere with the learning experience
of others. Therefore, please ensure cell phones are off, do not surf the
web on anything unrelated to class during class time, listen
attentively, and be respectful to the needs and priorities of all
students.

#### ASU Policy on Academic Integrity

Academic honesty is expected of all students in all examinations,
papers, laboratory work, academic transactions and records. The possible
sanctions include, but are not limited to, appropriate grade penalties,
course failure (indicated on the transcript as a grade of E), course
failure due to academic dishonesty (indicated on the transcript as a
grade of XE), loss of registration privileges, disqualification and
dismissal. For more information, see
<http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity>.

General guidelines for academic work include:

  - If you are quoting from a source, you must use quotation marks
    around that text AND cite that source.
  - If the text you are writing makes a specific and not commonly known
    point that is derived from a source, you must attribute that source.
    Paraphrasing, no matter what the source, requires attribution.

There are two important reasons for rules of attribution. One is to help
your reader find anything he or she might want to pursue in greater
detail. The other is to give credit where credit is due: because
something is on the web or “in public domain” does not relieve the
responsibility of providing appropriate attribution. Attribution is not
about the legalities of copyright but about the integrity of
scholarship.

#### Threatening Behavior

In the case of threatening or disruptive behavior by a student, policies
outlined in <http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm104-02.html> will be
followed.

#### Disability Policy Statement

  - **Disability Accommodations:** Qualified students with disabilities
    who will require disability accommodations in this class are
    encouraged to make their requests to me at the beginning of the
    semester either during office hours or by appointment. Note: Prior
    to receiving disability accommodations, verification of eligibility
    from the Disability Resource Center (DRC) is required. Disability
    information is confidential.
  - **Establishing Eligibility for Disability Accommodations:** Students
    who feel they will need disability accommodations in this class but
    have not registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) should
    contact DRC immediately. Their office is located on the first floor
    of the Matthews Center Building. DRC staff can also be reached at:
    480-965-1234 (V), 480-965-9000 (TTY). For additional information,
    visit: www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/ed/drc. Their hours are 8:00 AM to
    5:00 PM, Monday through Friday.

#### Title IX

Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis
of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and
university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex
is prohibited. An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual
violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling
and academic support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been
harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information
and resources at <https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs>. 

As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware
of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence
and dating violence. ASU Counseling Services,
<https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling>, is available if you wish discuss any
concerns confidentially and privately.
